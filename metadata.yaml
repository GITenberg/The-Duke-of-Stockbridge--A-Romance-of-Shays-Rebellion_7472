description: 'Although written in 1879 and serialized in a local paper, The Duke of
  Stockbridge was not published in book form until 1900, when it was revised following
  Bellamy''s death. The Duke of Stockbridge is set in the past: during Shay''s Rebellion
  of 1786. It''s soft and romantic, but hidden inside the sentimentality are hints
  of Bellamy''s political ideas.'
